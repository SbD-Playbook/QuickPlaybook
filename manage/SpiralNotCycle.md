# Spiral, Don't Cycle

[It's time to retire the crap circle](https://hbr.org/2013/03/its-time-to-retire-crap-circle)

## Skim First

Do it quickly then do it slowly - and then again at whatever detail you need.

You can work through this playbook the first time in detail, but it can be hard to consider each aspect in isolation as you work through it. Instead run through it first, quickly, at a high level.  After that you should have enough understanding to decide whether to pick and choose particular aspects to focus on, or repeatedly run through the whole playbook  each time examining each aspect more closely.

This also means that by the time you get to focus on the detail, you can put the various components in proper context and so direct that focus suitably.

## Improve Understanding

Each pass of the playbook should give you better understanding of the situation and what you can do about it. It should help you spiral towards good, rigorous, appropriate security rather than just cycling around a dead process. 

## Resources 

### Who do you need?
In principle you don't need to be technical to run the first iteration - and it may even be more useful not to be. It will be necessary however to have someone on hand who understands the 'space' that you are protecting: where your assets are located, which routes they are moved down or accessed through, where the boundaries are and what the connections are between the space you are protecting and the areas around it.

You should also have someone knowledgeable who can check your assessments, both to help assure *you* that you are doing the right thing (or correct you if you are not in some places) and also to assure your *customers* that what you are delivering is *suitably* secure.
