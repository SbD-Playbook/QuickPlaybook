# Why this playbook

Secure By Design is an approach to manage security through the project's risk registry. 

We also need a way of calculating those risks; in this case the **threats** to the various **assets**, the **impacts** of those assets being compromised, and the **reduction in risk** when controls are implemented.

We evaluated a few frameworks and based this playbook on NIST's Cyber Security Framework (now at v2.0), but this too is only a framework and not an implementation. 

Since this is a risk-based approach (that is, we want to calculate and manage risk, not just take risks), we chose NIST's SP 800.53 & 30 Risk Management guides for the scales and calculations. 

By themselves these are still quite broad and in our first attempts at Secure By Design we found we needed to extract the relevant details and tables into spreadsheets to calculate the residual risks.  This playbook provides those ready-to-go. 

## Checklists

There are ready-made checklists that you can use as an action plan for security controls for common situations such as developer team networks. 

These can be misleading for unusual situations, and they do not help us to understand the costs and benefits of risks and mitigating them, but they are a good starter.


## What it is and is not
We have a process, and a set of ready-partly-filled spreadsheets/tables/templates to help people write their own risk assessment.

The process has now been developed a bit further using a common western military threat assessment, to give us a reasonably systematic approach; that is a way of breaking the problem down, re-assembling it, and being reasonably rigorous. Or at least as rigorous as we need to be.

The playbook is in written form with some explanation videos and a few worked examples.
